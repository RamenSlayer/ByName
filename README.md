# ByName
 Blender addon including various functions that deal with aplying an action to multiple objects with similar names. (Technically everything is a derivative from the select by name so you can download only that one)
 
 So far added:
 Delete objects by name (3D View > Object)
 Select object by name (3D View > Select)

Very basic. Select any object with a name that includes a certain string. Useful for big scenes with multiple collections and duplicated objects.
